Roll dice, flip coins, and simulate other decision-making methods.

## Author(s)

- Jason C. McDonald (CodeMouse92)

## Another? Why?
Because I feel like it? Seriously, though, I am frequently looking for random generation programs, especially coin and dice simulators. It felt like a simple and fun project that could grow quickly with minimal work.

## Features
dicebox contains the following decision-making tools:

- Flip any number of **coins**.
- Roll any number of **dice**, of any type.
- Drawing straws
- Playing cards
- Sock drawer

dicebox will be first-and-foremost a command-line application. I may add an optional GUI later, but that's not certain.

## Technology

dicebox is written in Python3, primarily targeting the Linux command line.
